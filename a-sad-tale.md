House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark ended up adopting a lot of English Bulldogs and building a palace for
all of them to live in together. Each Bulldog had its own bed & they had a lot
of food for everyone to eat together.
